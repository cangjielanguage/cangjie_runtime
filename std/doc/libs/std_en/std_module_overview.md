# Cangjie Programming Language Standard Library API

The Cangjie Programming Language Standard Library (std) is a default library included with the Cangjie SDK installation. The standard library predefines a set of functions, classes, structures, etc., aiming to provide commonly used functionalities and tools to enable developers to write programs more quickly and efficiently.

The Cangjie Standard Library has three key characteristics and objectives:

- **Ease of Use**: The standard library is distributed with the compiler and toolchain, requiring no additional downloads from usersâ€”ready to use out of the box.
- **General Functionality**: The standard library offers the most frequently used library capabilities for developers, designed to address most fundamental problems.
- **Quality Benchmark**: The standard library strives to set examples and benchmarks in performance, code style, and other aspects for other Cangjie libraries.

## Usage Guide

In the Cangjie programming language, the standard library consists of several packages, where a package is the smallest compilation unit. Each package can independently output artifacts such as AST (Abstract Syntax Trees) files, static library files, and dynamic library files. Packages can define sub-packages, forming a tree-like structure. A package without a parent is called a root package, and the entire tree composed of the root package and its sub-packages (including sub-packages of sub-packages) is called a module. The module's name is the same as the root package's name and represents the smallest unit for developer distribution.

Package import rules are as follows:

- You can import a top-level declaration or definition from a package using the following syntax:

    ```cangjie
    import fullPackageName.itemName
    ```

    Here, `fullPackageName` is the full path package name, and `itemName` is the name of the declaration, for example:

    ```cangjie
    import std.collection.ArrayList
    ```

- If multiple `itemName`s belong to the same `fullPackageName`, you can use:

    ```cangjie
    import fullPackageName.{itemName[, itemName]*}
    ```

    For example:

    ```cangjie
    import std.collection.{ArrayList, HashMap}
    ```

- Alternatively, you can import all top-level declarations or definitions marked as `public` from the `fullPackageName` package using:

    ```cangjie
    import fullPackageName.*
    ```

    For example:

    ```cangjie
    import std.collection.*
    ```
